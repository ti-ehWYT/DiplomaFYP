# DiplomaFYP
My Diploma FYP. It was Covid Period, hence I came out mind of making a website to spread awareness and help people who has difficulties. It was coded by PHP and Javascript with MySQL databases. This was my first website that created whole by myself, hence it it not the best website but it was my best try that time.

To make it works, you will need to install XAMPP and run on localhost.
You will need internet access for the best experience like Map function.
Databases will need to manually insert into MyPHPAdmin first for existing data so it can be loaded perfectly.
